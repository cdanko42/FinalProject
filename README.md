# FinalProject

This paper performs a Bayesian data analysis of mass shootings in the United States between 2013 and 2019. The code generates visualizations plotting the results from Markov Chain Monte Carlo processes that are described in the paper. It also generates table summarzing the samples generated by the Markov Chain. The code also calculates and posts the beta distributions that inform the Markov chains. Methodology for choosing these beta distributions are contained in the paper as well. It also performs a number of binomial tests and generates tables reporting their results. 

To replicate the results of the project, run DataCleaning.R, then DataAnalysis.R in the Code folder. This will generate all the graphics that feed into the pdf paper. 

If the depository is set to the directory folder, the path to the data is in the code. The data is contained in the Data folder of the project.
